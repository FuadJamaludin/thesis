Hi Fuad,<div><br></div><div>the Fixed Operational and Maintenance cost (FOM=
) are given in our input data as a percentage of the investment costs. E.g.=
 for onshore wind turbines investment costs in 2030 are 1.04*10=E2=81=B6 EU=
R/MW and FOM are 12.6*10=C2=B3 EUR/MW/year so the FOM in our format as a pe=
rcentage are 12.6*10=C2=B3/1.04*10=E2=81=B6 =3D&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0122 per unit =
/ year =3D 1.22%/year.</div><div><br></div><div>We do have all the technolo=

<br>&gt; Hi everybody,

<br>&gt; I'm Alice Di Bella, I am currently writing my thesis for my Master
<br>&gt; degree in Energy Engineering at Politecnico di Milano using Pypsa-=
eur. I
<br>&gt; am currently having troubles understanding how the cost variables
<br>&gt; (capital_cost and marginal_cost) work.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; I'll be more precise: I ran a simulaion with 37 nodes in europe,
<br>&gt; timestep of 24 hours, using config.default.yaml and I don't unders=
tand
<br>&gt; how the capital cost is calculated.
<br>&gt; For example the capital cost for onwind, taken from
<br>&gt; network.generators.capital_cost is 109.3 =E2=82=AC/kW but in the d=
ata costs.csv
<br>&gt; the value was 1040 =E2=82=AC/kW. I know that I should consider a c=
ertain
<br>&gt; discount rate, but the difference is of an entire order of magnitu=
de, so
<br>&gt; I think it's a bit weird. Can anybody help me with this please?
<br>&gt; It would be important to go on with my work :)
<br>&gt;=20
